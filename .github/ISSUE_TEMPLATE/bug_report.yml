      **Is this the right place for my bug report?**
      
      * This repository contains the Raspberry Pi 4, Pi400 and CM4 bootloader EEPROM images and installation scripts.      
      * Please report boot issues for the earlier models at the GPU firmware repo [github.com/raspberrypi/firmware](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware).
      * Please report USB issues which occur after the OS has started at the Linux repo [github.com/raspberrypi/linux/](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/).
      * If you simply have a question, then [the Raspberry Pi forums](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums) are the best place to ask it. 
         * The ["Is your Pi not booting?"](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=58151) post has lots of useful advice.

      * `rpi-eeprom-update` saves a backup of the previous bootloader configuration to `/var/lib/raspberrypi/bootloader/backup` before it schedules the update.
      * `rpi-eeprom-config pieeprom.upd` can be used to read the contents of an EEPROM image.

    description: |
       If the problem can't be diagnosed from the bootloader HDMI diagnostics screen then we'll normally need to see more detailed logs to diagnose the problem. The bootloader and GPU firmware can be configured to enable log output to the UART pins `14` and `15` on the [40-pin GPIO header](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/os.html#gpio-and-the-40-pin-header)
         * To enable UART logging from the bootloader specify [BOOT_UART=1](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#BOOT_UART) in the EEPROM config
         * To enable UART logging from the `start.elf` GPU firmware stage add [uart_2ndstage=1](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/config_txt.html#uart_2ndstage) to `config.txt`.
         * If you are familiar with using Wireshark then it's also possible to use [NETCONSOLE](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#NETCONSOLE) write logs to UDP packets.
       Please paste the bootloader logs here.

       Before using USB as the boot device it's advisble to verify that the USB device is [compatible](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#hardware-compatibility) and works reliably from Linux. 
       Please specify the make and model of the USB device plus any HUBs or USB/SATA adapters. Please also capture the output of the following command from Linux `lsusb -vvv` and paste the results here.
